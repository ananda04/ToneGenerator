**Project Description**
-------------------------
Freediving is a captivating sport that involves diving underwater on a single breath, pushing the boundaries of human capability and exploring the depths of the ocean with minimal equipment. While free diving offers a unique and thrilling underwater experience, it also poses several difficulties. Having been in the water for long periods, many divers can develop hypoxia or decompression sickness. To solve this issue many divers use watches that allow them to monitor the heart rate, oxygen levels, and depth levels. Most of these watches can track and monitor vital signs and warn in case of potential harm or risk to the diver. While these watches are helpful, they are not preventative. This project aims to address these problems and improve upon current products produced in the free diving industry. Dukeâ€™s EGR102 team's goal is to create an effective data collection and signal analysis algorithm dedicated for efficiently analyzing data regarding different pitches, timbers, and audible tones at varying depths of water.  More importantly, the product should be able to stay underwater at 6 meters depth for more than an hour.
